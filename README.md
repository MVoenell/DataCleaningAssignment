# DataCleaningAssignment

In this project I used VS code for python and numpy and pandas for the calculations and data analysis before using streamlit for the graphing. 

I created Parquets of the weekly volume by sector, weekly average percentage return by sector and weekly count of validated trades because I want to see which sectors were the most active and profitable. Two of these intial graphs can be seen in HWScreenshot 3 and 4. After doing these initial graphs I tried a couple different graph styles and made weekly sector volatility and weekly sector share of market volume. As seen in HWScreenshot 1 and 2.

I chose to do weekly because with the data given the graph looks much cleaner and readable than when I tried daily and monthly would not have shown much data.
